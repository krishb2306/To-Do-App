# To-Do-App

This is my Global Guesser App. I themed it after national parks so I called it the Park Guesser. It works pretty basically, but once you open the app you can click on the instructions, which shows a modal containing it. Once you press play, you are brought to the game screen. On the game screen you just tap where you want your marker to be, and after you are happy with the placement you can press check.

The check button does not work if you dont have a marker down, this makes it so you cant break that part. Once you check you will see another map which has your marker, and the correct marker, alongside a line between the two. On the top you have the amount of points you earned out of 5000 and you have a progress bar to visually show how close you were. Under the map there is the name of the park and how far away you guessed in KM. 

Once you finish the game, another Modal will popup, which has information about your scoring. It shows your round score, last score, and best score.
