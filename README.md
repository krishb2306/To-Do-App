# To-Do-App

Welcome to my ToDoList App. The general purpose of this app was to make it so that you are greated only by the tasks you have ahead of you.
Essentially, the app is linked with your Calendar, so that any events during your day and shown in the app. On default you see your events for today and tomorrow. This makes it so that you focus on the most important things and worry about future events later. The app will automatically mark any event complete once its endDate has passed. The app also has built is storage, so that all your previous completed tasks stay completed. The completed tasks will only show the last 7 days. 

You can press on the "plus" button to add a new calendar event, which also will get added onto the app. For any events that have not been completed you can still edit them by pressing on the "i" button, which will let you change any part of it, or even delete the event as a whole. The reason I made the editing like this is because once an event passes, you should forget about it and move onto the next one, so I don't want you to edit it after its done.
You can click on the empty circle to the left, to mark an event complete. And you can press on a completed event to mark it as incomplete.
